# Submariner
A simple 2D game created to learn the basics of game development and JavaFX. I've used the project as a playground to try
different approaches to collision, physics, animations and other common building blocks of game development..

# How to play
The acceleration of the submarine is controlled with the W, A, S, D keys. Missiles are launched with the F key.

# Rules
You get points for gathering intel packages and successfully launching missiles to the surface. You take damage from direct
or shockwaves from explosions. The later will also affect the submarines movement.
